# Would You Rather Project

"Would You Rather" is a web based game that allows the user to answer tough questions made by other users by choosing one of two choices. The game has a leader board to see who is the most active user

# Added features:
I have added the ability to register. To do so click on the "register" button in the '/' directory. 
After being redirected to the new page enter your username and name, then choose one of two icons. After that click on register. You will be redirected to the login page where you will find the user you created. You can login using that account and use the web app normally.

## TL;DR

To use "Would You Rather", do the following

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
